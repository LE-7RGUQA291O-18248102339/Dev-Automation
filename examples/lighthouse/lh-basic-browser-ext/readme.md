**<u>NOTE:</u>** The Google Lighthouse tool runs within a web browser in two different forms as two different tools; (1) within the DevTools portion of the Chrome desktop web browser, and (2) as a browser extension.



## Tool 1: lighthouse in Chrome DevTools

Lighthouse can run as integrated directly into the Chrome Desktop browser DevTools, under the "Lighthouse" panel in the Chrome browser.

## Tool 2: Chrome extension

Before Lighthouse became available as a tool within the DevTools portion of the Chrome browser, it was available as a Chrome extension and offered similar functionality. Although this Chrome extension is still available, most prefer the version above that runs in the DevTools portion of the Chrome desktop browser.
