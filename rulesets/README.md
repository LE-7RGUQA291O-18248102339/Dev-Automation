### Rulesets (pass/fail criteria)

Not all accessibility standards can be tested using automation alone. For criteria that can be tested through automation, third party rules (pass/fail criteria) are not always fully in alignment with the DHS Trusted Tester pass/fail criteria. To help teams integrate test automation and implement it in a way that uses rules that align as closely as possible to Trusted Tester criteria, OAST has reviewed the rulesets for ***axe-core*** and ***HTML Code Sniffer*** and has made recommendations for which of those rules should be used for testing in order to be as “Trusted Tester friendly” as possible regarding test results.
